Hi! I'm a computer science student, currently interning at Red Hat.
This is my programmer's notebook. While I don't expect anybody to actually
read this, this is the internet, so it's within the realm of possibility.
It's nice to meet you!

As a stopgap measure before I set up comments on this thing, you can contact
me at:  
jmiu [a t] redhat [d o t] com.

###### I had too much fun doing that.
