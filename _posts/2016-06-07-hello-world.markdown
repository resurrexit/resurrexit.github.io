Finally. I don’t think anyone else is going to read this, but if you’re reading
this, and you’re not me – well. Hi! This is my programmer’s notebook, something
I’ve been wanting to start on for a long time.

A little about me: I am currently studying computer science at some university
somewhere. As of summer 2016, I am an intern at Red Hat with the Security and
Identity Engineering team. Most of posts (for now, anyway) will be related to my
work here.

I’ve written MIPS assembly, C, Perl, Python, Java, Objective-C, Scheme,
Smalltalk, Erlang, Prolog, and Swift all at different times in my life. Note that
I can only really claim to be proficient at a few of these.
